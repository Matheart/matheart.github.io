Here I also thank many senior researchers that help me shape my research taste and directions, including Jiaye Teng who introduces me to the learning theory world by [his awesome video series](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1k64y1r7Dv/), Yong Lin and Wei Xiong for teaching me research and understanding academia & industry, as well as Weijie Su who gave me valuable advice on how to conduct useful theory research.
