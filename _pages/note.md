- [**Information Exponents and Neural Networks**](../files/2025_multi_index_reading_group.pdf) 

This note is made for the reading group of [multi-index model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05426)[Section 5.1], including [DLS22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15144) and [BES+22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01445v1).

<!-- ## PhD Application
[This](https://www.zhihu.com/question/421349039/answer/4784236380) is where I recorded my PhD application experience (in Chinese).


## Undergraduate Course Projects
- **[Modern NLP Project at EPFL]** [**Finetune chatbot for education use via Direct Preference Optimization**](../files/CS552_NLPG_Project.pdf)
<br /> CS552 Modern NLP (Graduate-level)
It is an interesting experience since it was my first time to implement something related to LLM. Also intriguingly, we discovered both chosen and reject reward decrease at the same time in section 5.2, which echos discussions on drawbacks of DPO.

- **[OptML project at EPFL]** [**Investigations into Sharpness-aware Minimization**](../files/CS439_final_report.pdf)
<br /> CS439 Optimization in Machine Learning Project (Graduate-level)
We discovered that many theory literature on SAM assumes diminishing radius, therefore, in this project, we explored how radius, norm of the ball and the normalization affect generalization performance.
