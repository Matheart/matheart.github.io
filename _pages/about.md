Hi! I am an incoming Computer Science PhD student at University of Pennsylvania, advised by Surbhi Goel, and Enric Boix from Wharton Statistics and Data Science. I am about to graduate from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), with BSc in Computer Science & Mathematics.


My research interests lie in the **theory and empirical science of deep learning and LLMs**. 
- **Theory**: I am interested in theories that uncover fundamental principles of deep learning, as well as theories that can guide practical applications, such as mup transfer.
- **Empirical Science**: I am enthusiastic about using sandbox setups to explore the mechanisms of language models (and possibly the interplay with theory), including reasoning, alignment and interpretability.
