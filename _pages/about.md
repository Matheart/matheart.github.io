Hi! I am an incoming PhD student at University of Pennsylvania, advised by Surbhi Goel (CIS) and Enric Boix-Adsera (Wharton Statistics & Data Science). I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer science & Mathematics from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2025. 


My research interests lie in **theory of deep learning and LLMs**. 
- **Theory**: I am interested in generalization and optimization theories, to be more specific, the theories that uncover fundamental principles of learning (and scaling).
<!-- - **Empirical Science**: I am enthusiastic about designing sandbox setups to gain mechanistic understanding of model behaviors  (and possibly the interplay with theory), including interpretability, reasoning and alignment. -->
