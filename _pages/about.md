Hi! I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science & Mathematics in The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and is about to join MS/PhD Program in the United States. 
My research interest lies in **theoretical and scientific foundations of deep learning and LLMs**. I am very passionate about exploring and interpreting the hidden structure inside activations! Feel free to reach out if you share the same interests. 



<!-- ## Recent News -->


## Education
* BSc in Computer Science & Mathematics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, 2025
* Exchange (Computer Science), École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 2024 Spring 

## Research experience
* July 2024 ~ Jan 2025: Research Internship
  * Supervised under Professor Wei Hu @ Michigan
  * Worked on understanding linar representation hypothesis, and mechanism of compositional generalization under in-context learning setup

* July 2023 ~ Sep 2024: Remote Collaboration
  * Supervised under Professor Yiping Lu @ Northwestern
  * Worked on benign overfitting for PINN, and had a first-authored paper under review
  * Organized the Deep Learning Theory Reading Group inside the research group

* Oct 2022 ~ Nov 2023: Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) @ HKUST
  * Supervised under Professor Tong Zhang @ HKUST, PhD Student Yong Lin
  * [Paper accepted to ICLR2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17230) as coauthor
  * This work has an interesting finding that ensemble of models with spurious features can improve its performance, which is contrary to common belief on OOD that models should maintain invariant features and disgard spurious features like IRM.
