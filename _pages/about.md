Hi! I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Surbhi Goel (Computer Science) and Enric Boix-Adsera (Wharton Statistics & Data Science). I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Mathematics from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2025. 


My research interests lie in **theory and empirical science of deep learning and LLMs**. 
I am interested in designing minimal sandbox settings that are theoretically tractable while still illuminating fundamental principles of learning. 


I am also drawn to interpretability as an empirical lens for opening the black box of LLMs. More broadly, my interests in LLM lie in understanding the architecture, reasoning capabilities, and alignment properties via clean synthetic setup (In spirit of Physics of LLMs).


Overall I am passionate about opening the black box of neural network and LLM through all possible ways.
