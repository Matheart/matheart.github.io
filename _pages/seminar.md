# Seminars
This is the note taken in [**Wharton Statistics seminar**](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/), [**FOLDS Seminar**](https://jasonaltschuler.github.io/folds-seminar/) (Optimization & Learning), [**ASSET Seminar**](https://asset.seas.upenn.edu/events/) (Safety), and [**Theory seminar**](https://theory.cis.upenn.edu/seminar/). It is mainly for writing down things / resources that I learn from the seminars, and they are not guaranteed to be comprehensive or accurate.
