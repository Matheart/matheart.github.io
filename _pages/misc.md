Besides research, I am interested in exploring new things and travelling around the world. I enjoy watching anime, listening to vocaloid songs and reading visual novels! I am also running a [popular science channel](https://space.bilibili.com/346660989) which has over 34K subscribers and over 1.6 million views. My video series on Conwayâ€™s Game of Life has garnered around 500,000 views, while my Geometry series has reached about 600,000 views.
